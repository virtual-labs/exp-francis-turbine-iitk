### Procedure – <br><br>

	1. Note the inlet and outlet pipe diameters and measure the brake drum diameter and Z_1 and Z_2 i.e. the distances of inlet and outlet pressures gauge tapings from the centerline of the turbine.<br><br>
	2. Start the supply pump, keeping the guide vanes completely closed<br><br>
	3. Open the guide vanes partially (e.g.  1⁄4 or 1⁄2   of total opening),<br><br>
	4. Measure the discharge Q <br><br>
	5. Note the readings of pressure gauges<br><br>
	6. Note the readings of W (load on hanger) and spring balance S and shaft speed N <br><br>
	7. Vary speed of turbine by varying the load i.e. W and S on the brake drum and take six to seven readings in the allowable range of speed <br><br>
	8. Change the guide vane opening and repeat steps 4 to 7
