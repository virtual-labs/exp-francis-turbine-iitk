### Procedure – <br><br>
8.1	Experimental Setup<br><br>
<images src="images/image1.png"><br><br>
1.	A Francis turbine with an arrangement for adjusting the guide vane positions (hand wheel with suitable link mechanisms)<br><br>
2.	Supply pump unit.<br><br>
3.	Flow measurement unit (viz. venturi meter with manometer)<br><br>
4.	Tachometer.<br><br>
5.	Pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of turbine.<br><br>
6.	Rope brake dynamometer with spring balance connected to the turbine shaft.<br><br>

8.2	Formulae <br><br>
1.	V<sub>1</sub>=Q/((π/4) 〖d<sub>1</sub>>〗^<sup>2</sup> )      V<sub>2</sub>=Q/((π/4) 〖d<sub>2</sub>〗^<sup>2</sup> )

Where V<sub>1</sub> is absolute velocity of water entering
V<sub>2</sub> is absolute velocity of water leaving
Q= discharge
d<sub>1</sub>= Dia. of Inlet pipe 
d_<sub>2</sub>= Dia. of outlet pipe

2. H= (P<sub>1</sub>/w-P<sub>2</sub>/w)+ (〖V<sub>1</sub>〗^2- 〖V<sub>2</sub>〗^2/2g)+ (Z_<sub>1</sub>- Z<sub>2</sub> )
Where, Z<sub>1</sub> = Distance of inlet pressure gauge from turbine axis  
Z<sub>2</sub>  =Distance of inlet pressure gauge from turbine axis 
w = Specific weight of water

3. Input power: P_<sub>i</sub>=(w×Q×H)/75 
4. Output Power: P_<sub>o</sub>=((W-S)×π×D×N)/4500
Where, D = Mean Diameter of the break drum
N = Speed of motor in RPM

5. η=P_<sub>o</sub>/P_i ×100

1. Note the inlet and outlet pipe diameters and measure the brake drum diameter and Z_<sub>1</sub> and Z_<sub>2</sub> i.e. the distances of inlet and outlet pressures gauge tapings from the centerline of the turbine.<br><br>
2. Start the supply pump, keeping the guide vanes completely closed<br><br>
3. Open the guide vanes partially (e.g.  1⁄4 or 1⁄2   of total opening),<br><br>
4. Measure the discharge Q <br><br>
5. Note the readings of pressure gauges<br><br>
6. Note the readings of W (load on hanger) and spring balance S and shaft speed N <br><br>
7. Vary speed of turbine by varying the load i.e. W and S on the brake drum and take six to seven readings in the allowable range of speed <br><br>
8. Change the guide vane opening and repeat steps 4 to 7
