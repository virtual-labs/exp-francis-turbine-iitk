### Procedure – <br><br>
<b>8.1	Experimental Setup</b><br><br>
<image src="images/image6.png"><br><br>
1.	A Francis turbine with an arrangement for adjusting the guide vane positions (hand wheel with suitable link mechanisms)<br>
2.	Supply pump unit.<br>
3.	Flow measurement unit (viz. venturi meter with manometer)<br>
4.	Tachometer.<br>
5.	Pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of turbine.<br><br>
6.	Rope brake dynamometer with spring balance connected to the turbine shaft.<br><br>

<b>8.3	Procedure – </b><br>
1. Note the inlet and outlet pipe diameters and measure the brake drum diameter and Z<sub>1</sub> and Z<sub>2</sub> i.e. the distances of inlet and outlet pressures gauge tapings from the centerline of the turbine.<br>
2. Start the supply pump, keeping the guide vanes completely closed<br>
3. Open the guide vanes partially (e.g.  1⁄4 or 1⁄2   of total opening),<br>
4. Measure the discharge Q <br>
5. Note the readings of pressure gauges<br>
6. Note the readings of W (load on hanger) and spring balance S and shaft speed N <br>
7. Vary speed of turbine by varying the load i.e. W and S on the brake drum and take six to seven readings in the allowable range of speed <br>
8. Change the guide vane opening and repeat steps 4 to 7
